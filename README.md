# CRKBD BIG SANDWISH ACRYLIC CASE
![pic](https://github.com/Koumbaya/crkbd_big_acry_case/blob/master/pictures/collage.jpg?raw=true)
Just a big case for the crkbd, sandwish-mount.
Heach halves weights at about 320g once assembled.


# MAKING

Basically you need to laser cut 2 times the bottom-middle(x2, needed twice per halve)-switchplate-top1-top2-top3 dxf files in the dxf.
I've made two "single sheet" dxf, one with 2 times bottom-middle(x4)-switchplate and one with 2 times the tops. those fit inside a 384mm2 acrylic sheet (for exemple I just uploaded those 3 files on formulor.de and that gives me a complete case.
Everything must be cut in 3mm thickness, tho I guess you could cut the middle file into one 6mm thickness instead of 2x3mm.


# ASSEMBLY

You'll need 8 (per halve) M3x6mm hex nut/standoff (female on both sides), 8 M3x5mm screws (goes on the bottom), 5 M3x 12mm screws, 3 M3x16mm screws.
Note on the standoff/hex nuts : basically they exist in nylon or brass, the nylon one are larger, so the plates are cut to the size of the nylon ones, if you want to put the brass ones you can either resize the holes or put something to keep them snug in the hex hole.

Adding small bumpons to the underside of the case is always nice to keep it sliding on the desk.

There is 8 mounting points (per halve) but only 3 screws are visible, the other are hidden under the top layer. I might make a version where all are hidden but then I'd have to somehow glue or tape the top.

# NOTES

This is a quick project but it turned out about how I wanted it to be so I don't think I'm making any changes yet.
note on the TRSS cable cuttout : unfortunately I couldn't design it to allow 90 degree connectors, so its for straight connectors only
I added a 5 column version, I didn't try it, but it seems alright in the 3D view with switches etc, all I did was offset everything past the 5 column 19mm to the left. I didn't remake a "single sheet" version for the 5col dxfs, I'll leave it to you ;-)
